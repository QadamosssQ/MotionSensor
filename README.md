Project: Wemos D1 Mini + IR Sensor â†’ Discord Webhook This project uses a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) and an infrared interruption sensor to detect nearby objects. When an object is detected, the ESP8266 connects to Wi-Fi and sends a message to a Discord channel via a webhook. The setup runs on 5V and can be powered by batteries or USB.
